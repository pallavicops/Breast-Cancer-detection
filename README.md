# Breast-Cancer-Detection

This project aims to predict breast tumor status using machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier. Utilizing a dataset with 32 cell attributes, such as radius and texture, the model distinguishes between malignant and benign tumors. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score gauge performance. A user-friendly web application facilitates real-time predictions based on inputted cell attribute values, aiding timely diagnosis. By leveraging machine learning for early tumor detection, this project contributes to healthcare by providing a valuable tool for informed decision-making and advancing efforts in medical diagnosis and treatment.
